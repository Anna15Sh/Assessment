      Nowadays, modern web developers should to consider a huge number of various nuances in the web development
      process. A lot of resources have to be spent on ensuring compatibility of the project with a number of platforms
      and browsers. The web site should to function, if not perfectly, then at least as correctly and fully as possible.
      To ensure compatibility at this level, developers use various approaches that make it possible to unify a site.
      Therefore, it makes the website correctly accessible at various browsers and devices.<br>
      Before considering what is Responsive Design and for a clearer understanding what it is, let’s look on the types
      of models(layouts) that are used in the process of creating websites. There are four layouts: fixed, fluid,
      adaptive and responsive.<br>
      Fixed layout is a page’s layout where a content width is hard-coded in pixels. It does not vary depending on the
      browser window size. Fixed layout is a thing of the past, when the width of the page's content is strictly
      dictated by the resolution of the most popular screens.<br>
      Fluid layout is when instead of setting the width in pixels, we use relative values, usually indicated as a
      percentage. This type is also obsolete, since it takes into account only one type of device. Fluid layout does not
      care about how the content will look on screens with critically large or small widths. As the result, the website
      will look completely awful.<br>
      Adaptive layout sent to the user device media-queries that provide a data of its resolution and browser type.
      Knowing the current configuration of a specific user, we can offer the layout option that is suitable for the
      resolution of its devices. However, using an adaptive approach, we are again unable to consider all possible,
      including unusual device configurations which inevitably reduces the availability of the site. <br>
      Responsive layout combines the principles of fluid and adaptive types. Stretching the content on the screen,
      responsive layouts also take into account the data and media queries, making the layout accurately and smoothly
      adapts itself to the specific resolution.<br>
      Now we look at approaches and strategies for website development. It is more than a way of page layout as often
      includes problem-solving at the level of user interaction, the restructuring of the page, or even adapt the
      content provided to the user. Summarizing the methods for achieving such a unification, it is possible to
      distinguish two different concept - Adaptive design and Responsive design. In the community of web designers and
      developers, there is debate about the differences between these 2 approaches. Some believe that these two concepts
      are synonymous, and others that it is a completely different concept. The difference between these two approaches
      is that Adaptive design uses optimized templates and images for each type of device, while a Responsive design
      only stretches or narrows the content depending on the screen resolution of the device.<br>
      Speaking about Adaptive design, we mean by this concept of the universal website that equally well to work both in
      the smartphone browser and on the desktop. This approach based on strategies, concepts and techniques such
      responsive layout, progressive enhancement, and mobile first. We already mentioned about responsive layout before.
      Therefore, we understand how it works in Adaptive design. The concept of progressive improvement is providing to
      the user the full functional website, regardless of how outdated software it uses. CSS and JavaScript are used
      exclusively to improve the appearance and convenience of the site where HTML is a mandatory basis the site created
      for a progressive improvement of the technology. As for the third part of an adaptive design, namely mobile first,
      then more and more developers use this concept. The reason is simple; the mobile Internet is becoming more
      accessible and faster, as well as the number of users accessing the Network using various mobile gadgets.It should
      also be noted that Adaptive design is a strategy of development of websites and web applications, while the
      Responsive design is a technique to adapt the layout for different devices; often it is part of Adaptive
      design.<br>
      Responsive design using tools such as fluid and responsive layouts and flexible content, by which we mean
      "responsive" and stretch the images and videos. Responsive design is a simple tool. On Internet, you can find many
      sites created by Responsive design technology.<br>
      Principle and technologies of Responsive Design:<br>
      Content Out. There is need to study the inclinations of the audience and work out the structure of the content in
      such a way that it is logical and fully satisfies users. In addition to figure out which the content is a priority
      for mobile or desktop users, it’s necessary to clarify a number of technical issues.<br>
      Framework. When developing a website with the ideology of mobile first, the developer will need to choose the
      appropriate framework. This will be the key to a successful and convenient solution. <br>
      Media queries help the browser tell conditionals in CSS code how to style, hide or reveal elements of content.<br>
      Grids and Breakpoints. Using media queries within code, we can construct stylesheets with grids that respond
      fluidly to devices. In simply words, there is dynamically adjusting what and how the user sees the content based
      on the device and the width of a browser.<br>
      Some of these techniques such as Media queries and Grids are used in this project.<br>
      In the conclusion, Responsive design is a popular trend in web design resources. Responsive design is one of the
      main indicators of the quality of the site and very important recording today trends of using network devices.</p>
